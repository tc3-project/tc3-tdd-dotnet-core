# The Caribbean Coffee Company ![](./.common/logo.png?raw=true)
by Joel Mussman<br/>
original project concept by Joel Mussman and Justin Poole 

The Caribbean Coffee Company is a cafe-operations project that I have developed as the basis for doing demonstrations
and class labs for almost every software development technology that I work with, from databases through devices.
The premise is that a customer can use a web site or a device app to browse the menu of the cafe, place an order,
and pay for it.
Cashiers and managers also reach the back-end through the web portal and point-of-sale terminals.

## TC3-TDD-DotNet-Core

This project contains supporting components for a TC3 web service on which to to build TDD and unit tests.

Everything in this project is distributed freely under the MIT license (see below).
If you want to use it for demonstrations or as the basis of a lab for your own course, feel free.
I consider it to be a compliment and an honor that you want to use my material, and I would much rather be
a collaborator than a competitor!
